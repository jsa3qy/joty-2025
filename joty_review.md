17:03 Morgan: Seems really shady and creepy though, I wouldn’t be surprised if they did this before spring break knowingly
17:04 Adi: Not gonna lie, I’ve never heard of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which seems to be the cited reason for all of this 
17:18 Morgan: ￼Couple layers of ambiguity re: what groups she is a part of, what basis there is for thinking she is part of any group, and whether any group she is affiliated with is a designated terrorist org or supportive of one — any which way, this is part of a concerted campaign by a pro-Israel group to get a Palestinian scholar banned from teaching or getting funding and it seems like YLS is ready to roll over. People working in international human rights jobs interface with advocacy and activist groups — if they can’t do that and universities won’t defend them, idk under what principle academic freedom can actually be plausibly protected.  📷
    ↳ 17:21 Morgan: TLDR: some website - no author - claimed that the scholar is connected to a Palestinian rights group, Samidoun. That group, in turn, has connections to a Palestinian militant liberation group, which is deemed terrorist. But the scholar says she doesn’t even have connections to the first group, Samidoun, let alone the Popular Front militant group.

13:36 Shubs: Either 
13:45 Adi: ￼￼￼￼Good vibrations overall — went with Kevyn. Not much of a backpacking trip compared to what yall pull off ngl 

Hiked a few miles to Tenas Lakes in Oregon, scoped out a killer site and then just did some small side quests in the area. Hit a shrooms trip by the side of the lake for a few hours, did some mini hikes, swam in the lake 

Really enjoyed the trip (first backpacking trip for me with filtering water) but definitely some lessons learned 
- want to get to trailhead earlier 
- want to pack lighter 
- want to spend more time looking for a campsite 

Definitely will be hitting more trips and more involved trips soon!  📷

09:57 Adi: Showed the stripe tweet to Kevyn for a different perspective — she was also completely lost by the phrasing/construction of the tweet (“now that I’ve read this 20 times, it’s easy to parse” lol)

Some shared thoughts:

On the tweet: 
- for some reason neither of us could get over the phrasing/general presentation of the tweet
- Kevyn made the point (which I agree with) that Collison both dresses up his tweet via sophisticated language/references and dresses down his tweet via internet speak but for many readers achieves neither the added specificity you would want with more sophistication nor the added relatability often afforded by internet speak 
- overall we both felt like the tweet was very gatekeepy and status signaling — which is relevant because it calls into question the actual purpose of the tweet 

On the tweet’s points:
- claims seem plausible overall (might be somewhat cool if true), but generally unverifiable and a bit broad — not opining on the utility of Twitter generally, but I actually would prefer to see this in a substack because I think some detail would be pretty impactful 
- not sure how “what is worthy and valuable” is actually becoming *more* central — hasn’t this always been the central question for any entrepreneur? 
12:05 Jesse: If the question is “do people in tech think about what they’re doing and how it affects society” the answer is, ofc, some do. Even many. People have differing motives in my experience, some want a financial exit, some want to retire their parents, some are there by inertia and others are passionate about engineering. Theres no single mold, but in any case there’s a ton, and I mean a TON, of introspective content wrt what it is people are building and why especially with more high impact products like those in AI. A lot of engineers write blogs on all levels of the stack. 

>hasn’t this always been the central question for entrepreneurs 

Yeah I think this is my point. Is he asking what non elite start up founders are motivated by? Or the every day worker? Again, start ups are motivated by market viability and the upside of a technical space.. individuals then aid endeavors based on a variety of motives. This has always been the case, another interpretation is too heady

But if he’s asking what the elites care about, I mean, musk clearly has his motives, thiele his own, Zuck his own. If they feel less excited about doom scrolling and ai agent drones and Mars missions that’s their own boredom feigning as a broader philosophical shift imo. 

This idea that “I talked to some multi multi millionaires/billionaires and they don’t know what’s exciting rn” I just don’t get what this is talking about besides trendiness 

- websites were trendy
- apps were trendy 
- social media was trendy
- crypto was trendy 
- metaverse was trendy 
- AI IS trendy 

Are we concerned with what’s next ? It doesn’t read like that per se, he’s talking about what people think is worth working on broadly, but isn’t that just trends x market viability lol
